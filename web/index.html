        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p class="lead prose">
          ESCO is a European taxonomy that links occupations to skills and competences.
          Here we focus on an AI-related subset (occupations + skills) and use ESCO relations to study
          how AI competence is represented: what is defined as <em>essential</em> (core requirements)
          and what is defined as <em>optional</em> (peripheral specialization).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Main research question:</strong>
        How are AI-related occupations structured in terms of <em>core</em> (essential) and <em>peripheral</em> (optional)
        competences in the ESCO taxonomy?
      </div>
        
      <div class="grid-2">
          <div class="mini-card">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
              ESCO lists many AI-related occupations and skills, but it is not immediately clear
              which competences are shared across roles and which are role-specific.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="mini-card">
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
              We analyse occupation–skill links as a bipartite structure and use interactive views
              to compare core vs optional skills, shared skills, clusters, and bridges.
            </p>
          </div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="callout callout-subtle">
        <strong>Reading guide (storyline):</strong>
        we start from <em>how many</em> skills each occupation has (Section 1),
        then we ask <em>which</em> skills are most shared (Section 2),
        we add taxonomy context by positioning roles in the ISCO hierarchy (Section 3),
        and finally we show <em>structure</em> (clusters, niche skills, bridges) using a matrix and a network view (Sections 4–5).
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-subtle">
        <strong>Important note:</strong> this is a taxonomy-level analysis.
        Counts reflect ESCO modelling choices (which links exist, and how they are labelled), not labour-market demand,
        frequency, or hiring trends.
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-subtle">
        <strong>Data scope:</strong> in the visual analysis we keep only occupations linked to at least <strong>2</strong>
        AI-related skills (preprocessing threshold), to remove trivial/noisy cases.
      </div>

        <h2>1. How large is the AI skill core for each occupation?</h2>
        <p class="description prose">
          First, we examine the balance between <em>essential</em> and <em>optional</em> AI-related skills for each occupation.
          This addresses a simple but important question: does ESCO describe some roles as requiring a large AI “core”,
          while others rely mainly on a small essential set complemented by optional skills?
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="callout callout-subtle">
        <strong>Why this matters.</strong>
        The essential/optional distinction in ESCO reflects the difference between baseline requirements and role-specific enrichment.
        Large imbalances in this split across occupations therefore suggest different degrees of standardisation versus specialisation
        in how AI-related competences are defined.

        <h2>2. Which AI skills form a shared core across occupations?</h2>
        <p class="description prose">
          After comparing occupations, we switch perspective and rank skills by how many AI-related occupations they appear in.
          Skills that recur across many occupations represent a shared “baseline” in ESCO.
          We also distinguish whether a skill is labelled as <em>knowledge</em> (understanding) or <em>skill/competence</em> (doing).

        <strong>What to look for:</strong>
        do the most common AI competences look mainly conceptual (<em>knowledge</em>) or operational (<em>skill/competence</em>)?
        A mixed top suggests that ESCO models AI competence as both foundations + practice.

        <p class="takeaway">
          <span class="takeaway-label">Takeaway:</span>
          A small set of skills is shared across many occupations, suggesting a common AI backbone in the taxonomy.
          Less frequent skills tend to mark specialization or niche role requirements.

        <h2>3. ISCO context: where do AI-related occupations sit?</h2>
    
        <p class="description prose">
          So far, we treated “AI-related occupations” as a single set. Here we add <em>taxonomic context</em> by placing them
          inside the ISCO hierarchy (major groups → sub-groups → occupations). This answers a different question:
          is AI in ESCO concentrated in a few professional families, or spread across multiple parts of the labour taxonomy?

      </div>
    
      <div class="callout callout-subtle">
        <strong>Interpretation tip:</strong>
        bars represent <em>groups</em> in ISCO, and their values are the <strong>sum of AI-related skill links</strong>
        across all AI-related occupations contained in that group.
        This is not “how many people work there”, nor a demand signal — it is how ESCO <em>models</em> AI competence across ISCO categories.

          <span class="cap-label">What you can do:</span> click a bar to drill down to finer ISCO levels; use the breadcrumb to jump back to any ancestor;
          use <em>Back</em> or <em>Reset view</em> to navigate quickly.
          <span class="cap-label">Why it matters:</span> the drilldown reveals where ESCO places AI work:

          <span class="takeaway-label">Takeaway:</span>
          <span class="takeaway-text">
            AI-related occupations cluster strongly within professional and technical groups, with much smaller footprints elsewhere.
            Drilling down highlights which sub-domains (e.g., science/engineering vs ICT vs business) carry most of the taxonomy’s AI links.

      <div class="callout callout-subtle">
        <strong>Design choice:</strong>
        colours encode the ISCO <em>major group</em> (top-level ancestor). As you drill down, the colour stays stable to preserve orientation
        and avoid re-learning the palette at every level.

        <p class="description prose">
          Rankings are useful, but they hide structure. This matrix view makes patterns explicit:
          which occupations share similar AI skill sets (clusters), and which skills appear only in a few roles (specialization).

          The matrix makes co-occurrence visible, but a network view is better to reason about connectivity:
